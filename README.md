A Private, Serverless AI Chat App built on [Cloudflare Workers AI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/). Free to run, yours to own, one click to deploy. No backend server, no third-party services, no monthly bills. Deploy in one click and start chatting.

> **Alpha Software** - WaiChat is under active development. Core chat functionality works, but some features are incomplete (auth, UI improvements, mobile layout). Use for personal/testing purposes only.
>
> WaiChat is short for Workers AI Chat

## Features

- **One-click deploy** - runs entirely on Cloudflare's free tier
- **Multiple AI models** - switch between available Workers AI models on the fly
- **Streaming responses** - real-time output, no waiting
- **Conversation history** - sidebar with past chats, auto-generated titles
- **Flexible storage** - cloud (Cloudflare D1) or local (browser localStorage)
- **Auth-ready** - works out of the box with [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) for private deployments

## Deploy

### One-click
The easiest way to self-host WaiChat is via the Deploy to Cloudflare button below.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ranajahanzaib/WaiChat/tree/v0.1.1-alpha)

Click the button and Cloudflare handles everything automatically - no CLI, no config files to edit, no manual steps required. Behind the scenes it forks the repo into your GitHub account, provisions a D1 database and Workers AI binding, then builds and deploys the app to `https://waichat.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

### Manual (CLI)

Requires a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranajahanzaib/waichat.git
cd waichat
pnpm install

# 1. Create your D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create waichat-db

# 2. Set up your local wrangler config
cp wrangler.local.toml.example wrangler.local.toml
# Open wrangler.local.toml and paste your new database_id inside

# 3. Migrate and deploy
pnpm db:migrate:remote
pnpm deploy:production
```

## Auth (Optional)

WaiChat does not include built-in authentication. For private deployments, use [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to gate your app behind a login - supports Google, GitHub, and one-time email PIN out of the box, for free (up to 50 users).

See [docs/self-hosting.md](./docs/self-hosting.md) for a step-by-step setup guide.

## Storage

| Mode | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Cloud** | Chat history stored in Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). Default. |
| **Local** | Chat history stored in your browser's localStorage. No data leaves your device. |

Toggle between modes in the app settings.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend** - React + Vite
- **Backend** - Cloudflare Worker + [Hono](https://hono.dev/)
- **AI** - Cloudflare Workers AI (direct binding)
- **Database** - Cloudflare D1
- **Auth** - Cloudflare Access

## Free Tier Limits

Everything WaiChat uses fits within Cloudflare's free tier:

| Service | Free allowance |
|---|---|
| Workers AI | 10,000 neurons/day |
| Workers | 100,000 requests/day |
| D1 | 5M reads · 100K writes/day · 5GB storage |
| Pages/Workers hosting | Unlimited |

For personal use, you'll never come close to these limits.
