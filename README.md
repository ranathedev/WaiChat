## Deploy

### Recommended: Fork → Deploy to Cloudflare

The best way to self-host WaiChat. Takes about 1 minute, no CLI required, and you get automatic deployments whenever you sync your fork with upstream updates.

**1. Fork this repository**

Click **Fork** at the top of this page. Keep the default settings and confirm.

**2. Connect your fork to Cloudflare**

[**Open Cloudflare Workers & Pages →**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create)

Select your account if prompted, then **Continue with GitHub** → select your forked repository → **Next** → **Deploy**.

Cloudflare will build and deploy your app automatically. Your app will be live at `https://waichat.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

**3. Updating**

To get the latest WaiChat features and fixes, sync your fork from GitHub:

- Go to your fork on GitHub
- Click **Sync fork** → **Update branch**

Cloudflare detects the push and redeploys automatically within seconds. No manual steps required.

---

### Quick Start: One-Click Deploy

> **Note:** This option gets you running instantly, but your deployment won't receive future updates automatically. Use the Fork method above for long-term self-hosting.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ranajahanzaib/WaiChat/tree/v0.1.3-alpha)

Cloudflare handles everything - provisions a D1 database and Workers AI binding, builds, and deploys to `https://waichat.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

---

### Manual (CLI)

Requires a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranajahanzaib/waichat.git
cd waichat
pnpm install

# 1. Create your D1 database
npx wrangler d1 create waichat-db

# 2. Set up your local wrangler config
cp wrangler.local.jsonc.example wrangler.local.jsonc
# Open wrangler.local.jsonc and paste your new database_id inside

# 3. Migrate and deploy
pnpm db:migrate:remote
pnpm deploy:production
```

## Auth (Optional)

WaiChat does not include built-in authentication. For private deployments, use [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/access/) to gate your app behind a login - supports Google, GitHub, and one-time email PIN out of the box, for free (up to 50 users).

See [docs/self-hosting.md](./docs/self-hosting.md) for a step-by-step setup guide.

## Free Tier Limits

Everything WaiChat uses fits within Cloudflare's free tier:

| Service               | Free allowance                           |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Workers AI            | 10,000 neurons/day                       |
| Workers               | 100,000 requests/day                     |
| D1                    | 5M reads · 100K writes/day · 5GB storage |
| Pages/Workers hosting | Unlimited                                |

For personal use, you'll never come close to these limits.
