# Self-Hosting Guide

WaiChat deploys entirely on Cloudflare's free tier. This guide covers optional configuration for private deployments, including authentication via Cloudflare Access and live model fetching.

---

## One-Click Deploy

The easiest way to self-host WaiChat is via the Deploy to Cloudflare button below.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/ranajahanzaib/WaiChat/tree/v0.1.3-alpha)

Click the button and Cloudflare handles everything automatically - no CLI, no config files to edit, no manual steps required. Behind the scenes it forks the repo into your GitHub account, provisions a D1 database and Workers AI binding, then builds and deploys the app to `https://waichat.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev`.

---

## Manual Deploy (CLI)

Requires a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) and your `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` set as an environment variable.

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ranajahanzaib/waichat.git
cd waichat
pnpm install

# Create a database and configure your local wrangler file
npx wrangler d1 create waichat-db
cp wrangler.local.toml.example wrangler.local.toml
# Important: Add the generated database_id to your wrangler.local.toml

pnpm db:migrate:remote   # apply D1 schema to remote database
pnpm deploy:production   # build client and deploy worker
```

---

## Lifecycle Management (Updates & Rollbacks)

Once you have deployed WaiChat to your own GitHub repository using the One-Click Deploy button, you can manage your instance directly from your repository's Actions tab. WaiChat includes built-in workflows to make maintenance frictionless.

To use these workflows, navigate to the Actions tab in your GitHub repository, select the desired workflow from the left sidebar, and click the "Run workflow" dropdown on the right.

- **Update WaiChat:** Deploys the latest stable or pre-release version over your current instance. It safely aborts if there are merge conflicts.
- **Rollback WaiChat:** If an update causes issues, run this workflow and enter a previous release tag (e.g., `v0.1.2-alpha`) to safely revert your code and redeploy.
- **Dev: Test Upstream Branch:** To test a specific branch or feature before it is officially released, enter the branch name (e.g., `feat/ui-overhaul`) to deploy it directly to your existing instance.

## Authentication (Cloudflare Access)

By default, WaiChat is publicly accessible to anyone with the URL. To restrict access to specific users, enable Cloudflare Access directly from the Workers dashboard - free for up to 50 users, no zone or DNS configuration needed.

### Enable Cloudflare Access

**1. Open your Worker in the Cloudflare dashboard**

Go to [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → Workers & Pages → select your WaiChat worker.

**2. Go to Settings → Domains & Routes**

You'll see two rows:

| Type         | Value                                  |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| workers.dev  | `waichat.<your-subdomain>.workers.dev` |
| Preview URLs | _(preview deployments)_                |

**3. Enable Access on each domain**

Click the **⋯** menu on the right of each row and toggle **Cloudflare Access** on. Repeat for Preview URLs if you want those protected too. If you add a custom domain later, enable it there as well.

**4. Configure your Access policy**

After enabling, click the **⋯** menu again - you'll now see a **Manage Cloudflare Access** option. Click it to open the Access Control → Applications page in a new tab, where you can configure who is allowed in:

- Edit the policy to allow specific emails, or connect Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or any SAML/OIDC provider under **Settings → Authentication → Login methods**

**5. Test it**

Visit your WaiChat URL. You'll be prompted to authenticate. After verifying, you'll have full access.

> **Local Development Note:** Cloudflare Access blocks Wrangler's remote proxy session, which breaks `pnpm dev:worker`. Disable Cloudflare Access on your workers.dev domain while developing locally, then re-enable when done.

---

## Live Model Fetching (Optional)

By default, WaiChat uses a hardcoded list of Workers AI models. To fetch the live model list directly from Cloudflare's API (so you always see the latest available models), set these secrets:

```bash
wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
# enter your account ID from dash.cloudflare.com

wrangler secret put CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN
# enter an API token with Workers AI Read permission
```

Your account ID is visible in the URL when logged into the Cloudflare dashboard: `dash.cloudflare.com/<account-id>`.

To create a scoped API token:

- Go to **My Profile → API Tokens → Create Token**
- Use the **Read Workers AI** template or create a custom token with `Workers AI: Read` permission

Once set, `/api/models` will return the full live list sorted by recency and capability.

## Environment Variables

| Variable                | Required | Description                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | No       | Enables live model fetching from Cloudflare API |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`  | No       | Required alongside `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`      |

All other configuration (D1 binding, Workers AI binding) is handled automatically via `wrangler.toml`.

---

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm install

# Configure your local wrangler file first
cp wrangler.local.toml.example wrangler.local.toml
# Ensure you have a database_id set in wrangler.local.toml

pnpm db:migrate:local    # apply D1 schema locally
pnpm dev:worker          # start Worker on localhost:8787
pnpm dev:client          # start Vite dev server on localhost:5173
```

Add your credentials to `.env.local` for local development:

```bash
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here  # optional, for live models
```

Never commit `.env.local` - it's already in `.gitignore`.
